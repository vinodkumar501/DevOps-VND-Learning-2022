Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), 
Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

Java Development Kit (JDK)	Maven 3.3+ require JDK 1.7 or above to execute - they still allow you to build against 1.3 and other JDK versions

1.Install java as pre-requisite

source: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-apache-maven-on-ubuntu-18-04/

Install Specific Version of Java
If for some reason you do not wish to install the default or latest version of Java, you can specify the version number you prefer.

Install Specific Version of OpenJDK
You may decide to use Open JDK 8, instead of the default OpenJDK 11.

To do so, open the terminal and type in the following command:

step1:
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

step2:
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y

java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_312"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_312-8u312-b07-0ubuntu1~20.04-b07)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.312-b07, mixed mode)


check java path 

readlink -f $(which java)
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java

2. Download Apache Maven
At the time of writing this article, the latest version of Apache Maven is 3.6.0. Before continuing with the next step, check the Maven download page to see if a newer version is available.

Start by downloading the Apache Maven in the /tmp directory using the following wget command:


Step1: Download 
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz

Step2: Extract
tar -xzf apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz
 
Step3: Copy to /opt 
cp -r apache-maven-3.8.4 /opt

Step4:
To have more control over Maven versions and updates, we will create a symbolic link maven that will point to the Maven installation directory:

sudo ln -s /opt/apache-maven-3.6.0 /opt/maven
Later if you want to upgrade your Maven installation you can simply unpack the newer version and change the symlink to point to the latest version.

Step5: 
Setup environment variables
Next, weâ€™ll need to set up the environment variables. To do so, open your text editor and create a new file named maven.sh inside of the /etc/profile.d/ directory.

readlink -f $(which java)
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/maven.sh

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export M2_HOME=/opt/maven
export MAVEN_HOME=/opt/maven
export PATH=${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

Step6:
Make the script executable with chmod :

sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/maven.sh

Finally load the environment variables using the source command:

source /etc/profile.d/maven.sh

Step7:
Verify the installation
To validate that Maven is installed properly use the mvn -version command which will print the Maven version:

mvn -version
